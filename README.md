The Git workflow is based on this [post](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

_TLDR_

1. Features, bugs, Chores have their own branch. The branches are created off `develop` branch. When done working on a feature, bug or chore the work is merged to `develop`.
2. All `PR's` are opened against the `develop` branch pending review from the selected reviewer.
